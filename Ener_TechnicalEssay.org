The UK government has committed to the target of becoming net zero by 2050. This commitment is just one of the many similar such commitments to net zero made by governments all around the world. In this essay I will explore how a truly zero carbon grid could be realised with current technology, and with this framework highlight the fundamental trade-off and constrains which must be reconciled as a part of this transition.

* Current UK Energy Mix <<secCurrentUkEnergyMix>>
In 2020 UK annual electricity consumption was \approx =312TW=. Of this, roughly \approx =59.6%= was generated from inherently carbon neutral sources (Nuclear/Renewables). Annual UK demand is broken down by generation technology in Figure ref:figPie2020CumGen, carbon neutral energy generation is shown by relative energy generation in Figure ref:figPie2020CumGen.

* Capacity Factor (CF)
Capacity factor [fn::Also known as load factor] is defined as the total energy generated over a period of time divided by the theoretical maximum as specified by it's nameplate rating.

#+NAME: eqCFDeff
\begin{align}
CF= \frac{E_{total}}{E_{max}}
\end{align}

CF is a useful high level metric and can be though of as the degree of utilisation of a given generator. Depending on the generation type, the capacity factor will vary due to factors such as:
- Intermittency of generation
- Outages/Maintenance
- Political incentivisation/dis-incentivisation
- Curtailment due to overcapacity or network constrains

From Figure ref:figCFBreakdown we can see that capacity factor varies substantially between generation types. Wind and solar energy for example have a much lower CF than other generation. This can of-course be explained by the intermittent nature of the energy source, for example a wind turbine might be able to generate 8MW at high wind-speeds, however wind-speeds vary substantially throughout the day. Interestingly a noticeable difference exists between onshore and offshore wind, pointing to an advantage of offshore farms, that being greater consistence of generation.

Nuclear energy on the other hand has a relatively high capacity factor of \approx60%[fn:nuclearLowCF], this is largely because, as will be discussed further in Section ref:secLCOEvsCF, the key mechanism to lower cost of electricity is to increase CF.

#+caption: Breakdown of capacity Factor by Generation Type for 2019, Data Sourced from UK government [[cite:&NonRE_CF;&RenewableElecricityCap]], Tabular data in Appendix Section ref:secAppCFBreakdown.

#+RESULTS: pltCF
[[file:./.ob-jupyter/8af7b171434f52c001534a44e0e1e32c5e7c5b94.png]]
:footnotes:
[fn:nuclearLowCF] It should be noted that this capacity factor is substantially below the typical value which is often upwards of 80% however given the ageing nuclear plants in the UK the past several years have seen substantial outages for maintenance, and plants coming offline.  In this sense this capacity should be seen as artifactualy low.
:end:
* Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)
*** What is LCOE
Since we have established
Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is defined simply as the total cost of building, running and decommissioning an energy generation asset divided by it's lifetime generation cost.
#+NAME: eqLCOE
\begin{align}
LCOE = \frac{\text{Lifetime Cost (\$)}}{\text{Lifetime Production (KWh)}} = \frac{C_{Life}}{E_{Life}}
\end{align}

This is a vital metric for comparing the cost effectiveness and profitability of a given generation source. By accounting for profit margins and transmission/distribution use of system fees, this metric may also give a very rough insight into the likely end cost of energy to the consumer assuming a relatively competitive energy market.
*** LCOE Breakdown by generation Type <<LCOEBreakdown>>
#+caption: Levelized cost Estimates for Projects commissioning in 2025, £/MWh (Data is sourced from UK Government Figures Published in 2020[[cite:&DeptEnerLCOE]])
#+NAME: figLCOEbreakdown
#+RESULTS: pltBarLCOEBreakdown
[[file:./.ob-jupyter/8db2ae3ea8d23f67cdfb46f0d78029d25fe124bc.png]]

*** LCOE vs Capacity factor <<secLCOEvsCF>>
Choosing the optimal mix of energy generation is not simply a case of electing the lowest LCOE since the LCOE itself will be a function of the capacity factor and this capacity factor will be affected by the type of grid. This can be shown by assuming that the operational period (\(t_{hours}\)) and the levelized fuel cost is relatively fixed[fn:assumptions], we can then rearrange Equation ref:eqLCOE into ref:eqLCOE_5_final (see Appendix ref:secAppDerivationOfLCOEBreakdown for full derivation).

#+NAME: eqLCOE_5_final
\begin{align}
LCOE &= \frac{C_{Fixed}}{S_{Base\; kW} \times t_{hours}\times CF}+ C_{Fuel(\pounds/kWh)} + C_{carbon(\pounds/kWh)}
\end{align}


Examining ref:eqLCOE_5_final see that generators trying to minimise LCOE roughly have only one degree of freedom [fn:LCOEassumptions], that being capacity factor. Indeed we see in generation like Nuclear energy where fixed costs are high and fuel +carbon costs are low, capacity factors are often very close to 1 and even then the LCOE is relatively high relative to other generation types (see ref:LCOEBreakdown). Wind and solar energy on the other hand have no fuel or carbon costs and relatively low LCOE, even with substantially lower capacity factors than other generation. This is because the cost per installed kW capacity (C_{Fixed}) for wind and solar is so low that is compensates for this low CF.

:footnotes:
[fn:assumptions] It should be noted here that this is a very high-level analysis with many implicit assumptions, among them the assumption of fixed lifetime for a given generation type : This means that OEM costs which are roughly speaking a function of lifetime and capacity factor can be considered fixed costs.
[fn:LCOEassumptions] This ignores of course all of the other ancillary service which may be supplied on top of just energy.
:END:
*** Seasonality Vs LCOE <<secSeasonalityVsLSCO>>
The effect of seasonal variation on LCOE, can be derived by inspection of Equation ref:eqLCOE_5_final. To meet demand one must size capacity according to the peak demand effectively setting \(C_{Fixed}\) and \(S_{Base}\). One may assume these are linear with another so this has no impact on the LCOE. When the minimum in demand is substantially lower than the peak however, it necessarily lowers the system wide capacity factor and thus also increases the LCOE.

It should be noted here that where fuel is a dominant factor in the LCOE, there is less sensitivity to this lower capacity factor on the other hand, renewable generation is effectively inverse linearly dependant on CF.

* Future Space Heating Demand <<secHeating>>
A critical challenges in the transition to net zero is decarbonising residential space heating. As of Tue, 15/03/22 the future of heating in the UK is still very unclear. Until recently the UK has relied on the abundant gas reserves of the north sea for the vast majority of it's heating needs. These reserves however are dwindling, and beyond being in carbon intensive, depending in imported natural gas is expected to incur increasing cost, not to mention poses a geopolitical vulnerability. It is thus no surprise that decarbonising heating has received substantial attention from the government.

The current policy of the UK government seems to be leaning in the direction of full electrification of heating using heat pumps in combination with altered building standards for improved insulation. This approach has been met with some scepticism on the grounds of high unit cost of heat-pumps and relatively limited uptake [ =citation needed= ]. It is the authors opinion however that these limitations may be mitigated though shared ownership of units or some form of district heating schemes.

Competing proposals have also been made to utilise the existing gas infrastructure instead with hydrogen generated through electrolyse rather than fossil fuel sourced gas [fn:bioGass]. This approach has the advantage of the relatively high energy density of hydrogen [fn:HydEn] potentially allowing for relatively low cost energy storage [ =citation needed= ]. The potential advantages of hydrogen have also attracted significant attention in the transport sector, seeing research in cars, busses, trains and even boats. When competing with electrical storage such as batteries, or pumped hydro, it is still very unclear which, if any technology will decisively win-out in these sectors. If this were to occur,  it would likely substantial improve the economics of hydrogen for heating due to the potential to share infrastructure and in the benefits of research and commercial interest.

 As such currently only two plausible scenarios exist for UK heating energy[fn:options]:
1. Large scale Hydrogen gas network
2. Full Electrification using Heat-pumps

When considered from the point of view of the electrical energy network, these two options are both fundamentally consumers of energy, however the quantity and distribution of the load vary substantially in each case.

:footnotes:
[fn:options] It is noted that at least transiently, the end result will likely be some combination of both
[fn:HydEn] This is relative to the current energy density of Lithium Ion battery
[fn:bioGass] Biogas may also be used, however it seems unlikely that biogas will ever become a dominant source of heating due to fundamental limitations in available bio-matter
[fn:currentDemand] In this report gas demand for cooking will be considered under the same umbrella as heating demand though it must be noted that in the Heat-pump scenario this will lead to a minor underestimation in the projected future energy usage.
:END:
** Current Natural gas demand <<secCurrentNatGasDemand>>
Natural gas demand will be used as a proxy for the UK's current heating demand. In 2019 the UK's total natural gas demand was \approx863 TWh, of this, \approx377 TWh was in the domestic, commercial and public sector [[cite:&NaturalGas]]. This report will assume that the majority of this energy is used for space heating, meaning that this figure is a good proxy for the UK's total space heating energy demand that must be decarbonized through electrical means.

From Figure ref:figNatualGassDemandBreakdown It is noted that this sector, though the largest, still only amounts to \approx43% of total natural gas demand. With the exception of electrical generation, it is still largely unclear how many industrial uses of natural gas, for example the refinement of raw materials,will be decarbonised. A possibility is that net carbon syncs could trade their carbon capture capacity, or that these industries pivot towards zero carbon hydrogen. Both scenarios are likely to have substantial impacts on the network as a whole, however it is outwith the scope of this report to speculate future developments here so the influence of the remaining \approx25% (Losses, Other and Industry) will not be considered.

** Electrical Characteristics of Hydrogen Scenario
This section will briefly examine the implications of de-carbonisation of space heating using a purely hydrogen base approach.

*** Hydrogen Energy Storage
The key advantage of hydrogen is of course the greater ease of storage[[cite:&HydrogenEnergyStorag2]]. As such demand can be assumed to be dis-patchable to a certain degree, as long as the correct net energy is delivered. The option is also being discussed to attach

:notes:
- only used in a very subsidised form as energy storage... even still though it is probably just easier to store that for electricity usage
:END:
*** Hydrogen Heating Electrical Energy Requirements
In the case of the large scale Hydrogen network, at least as much energy must be supplied electrically to the electrolyser producing the hydrogen fuel, as will be used by the consumer to heat. Since current alkaline fuel cell technology such as Cummin's HYDRLYZER can attain up to 70% efficiency [[cite:&CuminsElectrolizer]] and there will be other energy losses due to compression and leakage [fn::Hydrogen tends to be substantially more leaky due to it's atomic size], we may safely assume that the electrical energy required per unit thermal energy used will be at least \approx =1.5=.

Base on the current Natural gas space heating consumption inferred in Section ref:secCurrentNatGasDemand, we can estimate the expected future demand assuming a full adoption of this technology [fn:hydrogenSpcHeatingAssumptions].

#+NAME: eqFutureSpcHeatingDemand
\begin{align}
E_{Heating\;Electrical\;(kWh)} = 1.5\times E_{Heating\;Nat\;Gas (kWh)}
\end{align}

This yields and expected additional annual electrical load of \approx =565 TWh=, roughly =181%= of the current annual electrical demand of \approx =312 TWh=. Restated, this would require an almost tripling in the UK's electrical energy generation capacity.
:footnotes:
[fn:hydrogenSpcHeatingAssumptions] This analysis is of course greatly simplified and makes a great many simplifying assumptions for instance: It is assumed that (despite plans to the contrary by the UK government) the space heating energy demand of the nation will remain roughly constant, though changes in building legislation aim to improve this on a per capita basis. This legislation will only be adopted in 2025, and then only apply to new builds, further more projections of the UK population grow forecast a rise of roughly 6.9% by 2030. It seems likely therefore that for the foreseeable future, this demand will not deviate enough to invalidate this analysis.
:END:

** Electrical Characteristics of Heat pump Scenario
*** Coefficient of performance
The coefficient of performance (COP) of a heat pump is defined as the ratio of useful heating to input energy.

#+NAME: eqCOPDef
\begin{align}
COP &= \frac{|Q_H|}{E_{in}} = \frac{Q_C+E_{in}}{E_{in}}\\
E_{in} &= \frac{Q_H}{COP}
\end{align}

Where \(Q_C\) is the heat moved from the cold reservoir \(Q_H\), is the total useful heating energy and \(E_{in}\) is the input energy.

Typical heat-pumps have COP in the range of 2-4 though the minimum to qualify for UK incentives is =2.9= this figure will be used as a base case in the subsequent analysis though it is expected that this figure will improve.

*** Heat-pump Electrical Energy Requirements
Again using the figure for annual UK space heating demand derived in Section ref:secCurrentNatGasDemand (=565 TWh=) and Equation ref:eqCOPDef, we can estimate the additional electrical requirement as \approx =195 TWh=, roughly =62%= of the current annual UK energy consumption. Note that this is not simply a case of adding an additional 62% capacity, to the network due to the substantial seasonal variability in natural gas demand that will be discussed in Section ref:secSpaceHeatingVariablity.

** Seasonality of Demand <<secSpaceHeatingVariablity>>
A key characteristic of heating demand however is it's inherent seasonality (shown in ref:figHeatingSeasonality) with peaks in demand often in excess of 5 times the minimum summer demand. This is a highly variable demand relative to the relatively stable variations in Electrical demand. Even with the factor of 2.9 reduction gained through the use of the heat pump, it is clear just by inspection of Figure ref:figHeatingSeasonality, that this seasonal spike in demand will require substantially more than just an increase in capacity of 62%.

#+caption: Total daily GB Natural gas and Electricity usage, 29_th Sept 2010 - 20_th Jan 2013, (Source:[[cite:&ukNatGasAndElecConsumption]])
#+NAME: figHeatingSeasonality
[[file:Figures/SeasonalEnergyVariation.jpg]]

** LCOE Constrains
A key constraint that policy makers will face, when attempting to address the de-carbonisation of electrical energy, is doing so without substantially increasing the cost of heat for the consumer. This naturally places a fundamental limit on the generation over capacity that may be installed since this will lead to higher LCOE due to lower CF. Further more, it is doubtful that energy storage based schemes

*** Breakdown of an energy Bill
A vital constrain when considering future energy mix is that the cost of electricity to the end user remain low enough so that consumers will have manageable heating bills. This means that on a $/kWh[fn::$/kWh is used for compatibility with the academic literature] heat energy must cost less than or in the region of the existing cost of gas. From this and the typical COP of a consumer grade heat pump, an upper limit on the acceptable cost per kWh may be established. This can then be roughly translated in an upper limit on the total LCOE of the generation sources on the network. From Figure ref:figPieBillBreakdown, we can see that the wholesale price of electricity, accounts for only \approx30% of the final bill.

** Summary
This degree of seasonal demand is something that has never been required of the electrical network before, and as discussed in Section ref:secSeasonalityVsLSCO, will necessarily lead to a rise in LCOE. It is the author's opinion, that the de-carbonisation of heating poses one of, if not the most substantial barrier to the UK's net zero plans.

* Predicted Future Zero carbon Energy Mix
Forecasting the future energy mix is the subject of extensive debate and is sensitive to a huge variety of unpredictable factors and unknowns such as government policy, geopolitical developments, to disruptive technologies. This analysis however starts with the assumption that the UK grid is indeed to be truly decarbonized and attempts to reason how this might look with current technologies. In this section will investigate which combination of technologies would likely provide the bulk of energy. The technologies considered here will simply be based on the current dominant sources of renewable and zero carbon energy on the UK grid shown in Figure ref:figPie2020CumGen as the only other dominant zero carbon energy source.

  + The cost of custom hydrogen storage is relatively high unless there is favourable geology

- Relative Advantages of heat-pumps
  + Heat-pumps can heat substantially more thermal energy per watt since typical coefficients of performance are in the range of 3-4 (meaning for every 1watt of electrical energy 3-4 watts of thermal energy may be moved)
  + Electrical energy must first be electrolysed and compressed before transport incurring losses on the order of 30%, Further losses incurred by leakage in transport depend heavily on technology [ =ref needed= ]
  + Hydrogen still requires the end user to own a gas boiler, which is only a small fraction of the cost of a heat-pump, but still not significant
- Siemens Gamesa is trailing using electrolysis equipment direly on offshore wind turbines with the idea being to supply future hydrogen based transport
  + It seems in the current proposed scheme, these turbines would not even be connected to the mainland

** Biomass <<secBioGas>>
This section will be concerned with exploring the scalability and potential role that biomass may play in the future energy mix. For clarity, "biomass" in this essay will refer to a subset of generation types which produce energy from once living organisms [fn::Note recently living i.e. not fossils] either by direct combustion or by generating gas through anerobic digestion.

A breakdown of the various technologies that constitute biomass energy is shown in Figure ref:figPie2020BiomassBreakdown. The reader should note that the totality of this chart represents only roughly 12.6% of the total UK electrical energy production that energy in the year 2020 [[cite:&BiomassPolicyStatement]]. Many of these technologies vary substantially in their scalability and as such the following key technologies will be treated individually.

- Plant Biomass
- Anaerobic Digestion
- Energy from waste
- Landfill Gas

Other biomass technology will not be considered in this report due to it's expected low future utilization.

[[file:./.ob-jupyter/603c0a61cc39a759145c8c2636878e943182f773.png]]

*** Plant Biomass Combustion
Plant biomass combustion is by far the dominant form of Biomass generation in the UK accounting for \approx68.3% of total Biomass energy in the year 2020. The vast majority of this is in the form of wood bi-products and pellets imported from the united states and Canada [[cite:&BiomassPolicyStatement]].

Drax power plant is the largest biomass power plant in the UK, accounting for the vast majority of the UK's bio-energy production. The power station has six 660MW units, four of which were converted to purely biomass in 2016 yielding a total biomass capacity of 2.6GW. With the UK government's policy to phase out coal power by 2024 various plans were made to convert the remaining two units to gas and install carbon capture technology, however due to limited interest from the government, both plans have failed [[cite:&EndtoCoal2024]].

In theory, using such bio-fuels is net carbon neutral since the trees are harvested from managed woodlands which will regrow and recapture the emitted carbon, however there have been serious concerns raised about the transparency and traceability of the suppliers of these wooden pellets.

**** Scalability
Currently the UK based biomass schemes are heavily reliant on foreign imported feedstock in the form of wood pellets. Indeed, Drax is the larges single buyer of such wooden pellets in the world. Not only does the shipping of these pellets incur carbon emissions, it also hints at another inherent limit of this technology, that being land surface area. With the large majority of the UK being farmland, only around 13% remains as forest, amounting to around 3.23 million hectares. The UK is already heavily dependant on foreign timber for the building sector, and wooden pellets imports have currently eclipsed these as the dominant import at 9.1million Tons [[cite:&ForestResearch]].

With the current generation demand for feedstock well outpacing domestic production with even this limited scale of operations currently providing only \approx8.6% of the current UK electricity demand, it is difficult to see how this technology will continue to scale. The UK is currently the leader in Biomass energy, however this technology is currently seeing rapid growth throughout Asia, America and the rest of Europe. Currently the production of these pellets is primarily limited to waste materials from wood mills meaning that the pellets are relatively low cost compared to timber. However as demand rapidly grows it seems highly likely that, producers will be increasingly forced to harvest timber purely to meet pellet demand driving up prices. Indeed there are already allegations that some of the largest producers of pellet feedstock are using whole trees, rather than the claimed waste material [[cite:&BioPelletsWholeTrees]].

Even though the UK is an outlier in it's overall population density it still seems unlikely that global forestry stocks could be a viable replacement for global fossil fuel consumption. Currently wooden pellets production in the United States only amount to around 8.6 million tons, only around \approx5% of it's total timber production[[cite:&USTimberPoduction;&UNForresteryDB]]. In some sense the early adopters of this technology are in somewhat of a catch 22, whereby if this technology does prove to be scalable and cost effective then there will certainly be much greater competition for feedstock acting to drive up the price.

**** LCOE
According to figures from the figures from the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, the LCOE of dedicated biomass is estimated at 98 £/KWh making it roughly \approx170% more expensive than offshore wind [[cite:&DeptEnerLCOE]].

It does however provide the interesting possibility of acting as a form of long term energy storage which may be dispatched to compensate from variable renewable sources. Another inherent benefit of this technology is that given it utilises large scale steam turbines driving synchronous generators is that it inherently also provides inertia to the grid, acting to improve the stability of the network as a whole.

**** Summary
In summary, it is the authors view that while plant biomass may provide very limited carbon sequestration and energy storage, it seems unlikely that this technology could scale to replace the energy currently provided by fossil fuels. The numeric analysis of the prior section substantiates a long-held intuition of the author on biomass energy. That being: By combusting fossil fuels, industrial nations for the past \approx150 years have, in a relative eye-blink, consumed the stored residual energy of the biosphere which has been gradually accumulated over a period between \approx20-400 Million years. To think that this rate of energy consumption could be sated, even in part, by a fraction of it's instantaneous output , in the form of plant biomass, is unrealistic.

Where \(k\) is a constant proportional to operational lifetime and nameplate rating.

\begin{align}
k = S_{Base\; kW} \times t_{hours}
\end{align}

Substituting ref:eqELifetime into ref:eqLCOE we get ref:eqLCOE_2:

#+NAME: eqLCOE_2
\begin{align}
LCOE = \frac{C_{Life}(CF)}{k\times CF}

We must note here that \(C_{Life}\) is itself a function of CF of the form:

#+NAME: eqCostLifetime
\begin{align}
C_{Life}(CF) = C_{Fixed}+C_{Fuel Life}(CF)+C_{carbon\;Life}(CF)
\end{align}

The carbon cost of burning the fuel will be roughly proportional to the CF and may be defined with the constant \beta which can be defined in terms of the levelized cost of carbon (\(C_{carbon (\pounds/kWh)}\)) for this given fuel taking into account the carbon efficiency of the fuel and the current carbon tax.

#+NAME: eqCFuel
\begin{align}
C_{carbon} &= \beta \times CF\\
\beta &= S_{base\;kWh} \times C_{carbon (\pounds/kWh)} \times t_{hours}

\(C_{Fuel Life}\) May be defined in terms of the cost of fuel per unit Energy (\(C_{Fuel/KWH}\)) The operational lifetime of the plant in hours (\(t_{hours}\)) and the Base rating: (\(S_{Base}\)) for simplicity these factors are grouped into a term \alpha:

#+NAME: eqAlpha
\begin{align}
C_{Fuel Life} &= \alpha\times CF\\
\alpha &= S_{base KW}\times t_{hours} \times C_{Fuel(\pounds/KWH)}
\end{align}

Substituting ref:eqAlpha into ref:eqCostLifetime we get:

\begin{align}
C_{Life}(CF) = C_{Fixed}+CF\times \alpha + \beta \times CF
\end{align}

Substituting ref:eqCostLifetime_2 back into ref:eqLCOE_2:

#+NAME: eqLCOE_3
\begin{align}
LCOE = \frac{C_{Fixed} +CF\times \alpha +CF\times \beta}{k\times CF}
\end{align}

Rearranging ref:eqLCOE_3:

#+NAME: eqLCOE_3
\begin{align}
LCOE &= \frac{C_{Fixed}}{k\times CF}+\frac{CF\times \alpha}{k\times CF}+ \frac{CF\times \beta}{CF \times k\times CF}  \\
LCOE &= \frac{C_{Fixed}}{k\times CF}+\frac{\alpha}{k} + \frac{\beta}{k}
\end{align}

Substituting definitions of \alpha and k from ref:eqAlpha, ref:eqk respectively:
#+NAME: eqLCOE_4
\begin{align}
LCOE &= \frac{C_{Fixed}}{S_{Base\; kW} \times t_{hours}\times CF}+\frac{S_{base KW}\times t_{hours} \times C_{Fuel(\pounds/KWH)}+ S_{base\;kWh} \times C_{carbon (\pounds/kWh)} \times t_{hours}
}{S_{Base\; kW} \times t_{hours}}
\end{align}

Cancelling:

#+NAME: eqLCOE_5
\begin{align}
LCOE &= \frac{C_{Fixed}}{S_{Base\; kW} \times t_{hours}\times CF}+ C_{Fuel(\pounds/kWh)} + C_{carbon(\pounds/kWh)}
