  + Implications of a truly zero carbon grid
  + assuming no significant change in the energy generation landscape
  + conclusion is that the way in which the grid has operated for the last 100 years or so whereby consumers have had uninterrupted supply to cheap energy, is not sustainable, merely a byproduct of the vast abundance of stored energy in the form of fossil fuels.

- Potential Demand side Capabilities
  + how fast can different types of loads switch
  + better integration of white goods
The crux of the argument is as follows
- A much more variable supply of electricity is an inevitable outcome of a fully net zero grid
- To make the transition possible the cost of electricity *must* remain low to enable its use for heating
  + it must remain cost competitive with just burning fuel!
- Atomic energy is maximally cost efficient when It is running full tilt and only then it is marginal
  + Atomic energy is valuable in the fact it provides spinning reserve
  + and a base load
- It may be necessary to keep some gas turbines in service using hydrogen fuel, as rapidly disposable generation

The UK government has committed to the target of becoming net zero by 2050. This commitment is just one of the many similar such commitments to net zero made by governments all around the world. In this essay I will explore how a truly zero carbon grid could be realised with current technology, and with this framework highlight the fundamental trade-off and constrains which must be reconciled as a part of this transition.

* LCOE
*** What is LCOE
Since we have established
Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is defined simply as the total cost of building, running and decommissioning an energy generation asset divided by it's lifetime generation cost.
#+NAME: eqLCOE
\begin{align}
LCOE = \frac{\text{Lifetime Cost (\$)}}{\text{Lifetime Production (KWh)}}
\end{align}

This is a vital metric for comparing the cost effectiveness and profitability of a given generation source. By accounting for profit margins and transmission/distribution use of system fees, this metric may also give a very rough insight into the likely end cost of energy to the consumer assuming a relatively competitive energy market.

*** LCOE by generation Type

* Zero carbon Energy Mix
Forecasting the future energy mix is the subject of extensive debate and is sensitive to a huge variety of unpredictable factors and unknowns such as government policy, geopolitical developments, to disruptive technologies. This analysis however starts with the assumption that the UK grid is indeed to be truly decarbonized and attempts to reason how this might look with current technologies. In this section will investigate which combination of technologies would likely provide the bulk of energy. The technologies considered here will simply be based on the current dominant sources of renewable and zero carbon energy on the UK grid shown in Figure ref:figPie2020CumGen as the only other dominant zero carbon energy source.

Use in Heating
- In heating hydrogen has the following advantages
  + Existing gas infrastructure may be used
  + Energy may be stored more easily than the equivalent Battery
  + The cost of custom hydrogen storage is relatively high unless there is favourable geology

- Relative Advantages of heat-pumps
  + Heat-pumps can heat substantially more thermal energy per watt since typical coefficients of performance are in the range of 3-4 (meaning for every 1watt of electrical energy 3-4 watts of thermal energy may be moved)
  + Electrical energy must first be electrolysed and compressed before transport incurring losses on the order of 30%, Further losses incurred by leakage in transport depend heavily on technology [ =ref needed= ]
  + Hydrogen still requires the end user to own a gas boiler, which is only a small fraction of the cost of a heat-pump, but still not significant
- Siemens Gamesa is trailing using electrolysis equipment direly on offshore wind turbines with the idea being to supply future hydrogen based transport
  + It seems in the current proposed scheme, these turbines would not even be connected to the mainland

** Biomass <<secBioGas>>
This section will be concerned with exploring the scalability and potential role that biomass may play in the future energy mix. For clarity, "biomass" in this essay will refer to a subset of generation types which produce energy from once living organisms [fn::Note recently living i.e. not fossils] either by direct combustion or by generating gas through anerobic digestion.

A breakdown of the various technologies that constitute biomass energy is shown in Figure ref:figPie2020BiomassBreakdown. The reader should note that the totality of this chart represents only roughly 12.6% of the total UK electrical energy production that energy in the year 2020 [[cite:&BiomassPolicyStatement]]. Many of these technologies vary substantially in their scalability and as such the following key technologies will be treated individually.

- Plant Biomass
- Anaerobic Digestion
- Energy from waste
- Landfill Gas

Other biomass technology will not be considered in this report due to it's expected low future utilization.

*** Plant Biomass Combustion
Plant biomass combustion is by far the dominant form of Biomass generation in the UK accounting for \approx68.3% of total Biomass energy in the year 2020. The vast majority of this is in the form of wood bi-products and pellets imported from the united states and Canada [[cite:&BiomassPolicyStatement]].

Drax power plant is the largest biomass power plant in the UK, accounting for the vast majority of the UK's bio-energy production. The power station has six 660MW units, four of which were converted to purely biomass in 2016 yielding a total biomass capacity of 2.6GW. With the UK government's policy to phase out coal power by 2024 various plans were made to convert the remaining two units to gas and install carbon capture technology, however due to limited interest from the government, both plans have failed [[cite:&EndtoCoal2024]].

In theory, using such bio-fuels is net carbon neutral since the trees are harvested from managed woodlands which will regrow and recapture the emitted carbon, however there have been serious concerns raised about the transparency and traceability of the suppliers of these wooden pellets. Currently the UK based biomass schemes are heavily reliant on foreign imported feedstock in the form of wood pellets. Indeed, Drax is the larges single buyer of such wooden pellets in the world. Not only does the shipping of these pellets incur carbon emissions, it also hints at another inherent limit of this technology, that being land surface area. With the large majority of the UK being farmland, only around 13% remains as forest, amounting to around 3.23 million hectares. The UK is already heavily dependant on foreign timber for the building sector, and wooden pellets imports have currently eclipsed these as the dominant import at 9.1million Tons [[cite:&ForestResearch]].

With the current generation demand for feedstock well outpacing domestic production with even this limited scale of operations currently providing only \approx8.6% of the current UK electricity demand, it is difficult to see how this technology will continue to scale. The UK is currently the leader in Biomass energy, however this technology is currently seeing rapid growth throughout Asia, America and the rest of Europe. Currently the production of these pellets is primarily limited to waste materials from wood mills meaning that the pellets are relatively low cost compared to timber. However as demand rapidly grows it seems highly likely that, producers will be increasingly forced to harvest timber purely to meet pellet demand driving up prices. Indeed there are already allegations that some of the largest producers of pellet feedstock are using whole trees, rather than the claimed waste material [[cite:&BioPelletsWholeTrees]].

Even though the UK is an outlier in it's overall population density it still seems unlikely that global forestry stocks could be a viable replacement for global fossil fuel consumption. Currently wooden pellets production in the United States only amount to around 8.6 million tons, only around \approx5% of it's total timber production[[cite:&USTimberPoduction;&UNForresteryDB]]. In some sense the early adopters of this tecnology are in somewhat of a catch 22, whereby if this tecnology does prove to be scaleable and cost effective then there will certainly be much greater competition for feedstock acting to drive up the price.

According to figures from the figures from the Department of Buisness, Energy & Industrial Strategy, the LCOE of dedicated biomass is estimated at 98 £/KWh making it rougly \approx170% more expensive than offshore wind [[cite:&DeptEnerLCOE]].

It does however provide the interesting possibility of acting as a form of long term energy storage which may be dispatched to compensate from variable renewable sources. Another inherent benefit of this technology is that given it utilises large scale steam turbines driving syncrinous generators is that it inherently also provides inertia to the grid, acting to improve the stability of the network as a whole.

In summary, it is the authors view that due to lack of domestic forestry capacity

* Constraints
To bound the problem we may set constraints on aspects of this proposed future grid to help narrow down the problem.

** Cost of electricity

*** Breakdown of an energy Bill
A vital constrain when considering future energy mix is that the cost of electricity to the end user remain low enough so that consumers will have manageable heating bills. This means that on a $/kWh[fn::$/kWh is used for compatibility with the academic literature] heat energy must cost less than or in the region of the existing cost of gas. From this and the typical COP of a consumer grade heat pump, an upper limit on the acceptable cost per kWh may be established. This can then be roughly translated in an upper limit on the total LCOE of the generation sources on the network. From Figure ref:figPieBillBreakdown, we can see that the wholesale price of electricity, accounts for only \approx30% of the final bill.

** Consistency, Overcapacity and Energy Storage Trade-off
When faced with a highly variable energy supply one obvious degree of freedom is to oversize the system capacity. Though the minimum and maximum available generation would likely still vary with the same shape, the absolute value of the minimum would have increased meaning the absolute size of any generation shortfall, would be diminished. This has the obvious downside of resulting in a direct increase in costs due to the increased number/capacity of assets which would be directly be passed onto the levelized cost of electricity and thus the cost to the consumer. Where /reliability/ is defined as the fraction of time that demand is less than the available energy, one would expect there would be diminishing returns on /reliability/ for increases in capacity simply due to the statistical nature of renewable availability.

To fully derive the degree of capacity required to guarantee 100% energy fundamentally depends on the statistical variation of the available energy of the renewable resources and the total energy storage capacity on the network. Producing an accurate figure for this is near to impossible would require complex statistical modelling along with substantial knowledge assumptions regarding the energy storage capacity of the network, thus the calculation conducted here should merely be seen as proving a ballpark figure.

Through a comprehensive study of observed wind speed data from 66 sites across the UK and statistical analysis, Sinden [[cite:&2007]] showed that that the seasonal average wind power availability varies by only approximately \pm 10% of the yearly average. It was also shown that the total period of time per year where the entirety of the year where 90% of the UK experiences low wind is less than one hour.

For this analysis, Wind and solar data from the UK website gridwatch [[cite:&gridwatch]] for the year 2020-2021. By assuming that the entirety of the UK's wind resource is not curtailed due to [fn::this may seem like a substantial assumption, but ]


meaning  it would likely be require oversize Since a fundamental requirement of any stable grid be that reliability always be 100% (i.e. available generation > demand)

It is therefore expected that for the lower cost generation sources such as solar and offshore wind, there will be substantial over capacity while the nuclear fission plants operate continuously at near full capacity.

* Future Energy Demand
In this section I will briefly cover the likely trends in the UK's energy demand and what influence this may have on the electrical market. The three key areas of focus are:
- Heating Demand ref:secHeating
- Data Centres ref:secDataCenters
- Electric Vehicles ref:secEVs

*** Heating <<secHeating>>
A critical challenges in the transition to net zero is decarbonising residential space heating. As of <2022-03-15 Tue>, the future of heating in the UK is still very unclear. Until recently the UK has relied on the abundant gas reserves of the north sea for the vast majority of it's heating needs. These reserves however are dwindling, and beyond being in carbon intensive, depending in imported natural gas is expected to incur increasing cost, not to mention poses a geopolitical vulnerability. It is thus no surprise that decarbonising heating has received substantial attention from the government.

The current policy of the UK government seems to be leaning in the direction of full electrification of heating using heat pumps in combination with altered building standards for improved insulation. This approach has been met with some scepticism on the grounds of high unit cost of heat-pumps and relatively limited uptake [ =citation needed= ]. It is the authors opinion however that these limitations may be mitigated though shared ownership of units or some form of district heating schemes.

Competing proposals have also been made to utilise the existing gas infrastructure instead with hydrogen generated through electrolyse rather than fossil fuel sourced gas [fn:bioGass]. This approach has the advantage of the relatively high energy density of hydrogen [fn:HydEn] potentially allowing for relatively low cost energy storage [ =citation needed= ]. The potential advantages of hydrogen have also attracted significant attention in the transport sector, seeing research in cars, busses, trains and even boats. When competing with electrical storage such as batteries, or pumped hydro, it is still very unclear which, if any technology will decisively win-out in these sectors. If this were to occur,  it would likely substantial improve the economics of hydrogen for heating due to the potential to share infrastructure and in the benefits of research and commercial interest.

 As such only two plausible futures exist for heating energy[fn:options]:

1. Large scale Hydrogen gas network
2. Full Electrification using Heat-pumps

When considered from the point of view of the electrical energy network, these two options are both fundamentally consumers of energy, however the quantity and distribution of the load vary substantially. First of all, green hydrogen must first be generated using electrolyse. Current alkaline fuel cell technology such as Cummin's HYDRLYZER can attain up to 70% efficiency [[cite:&CuminsElectrolizer]]. Depending on the application, the hydrogen may then need to be compressed for storage/transport. This stage can lead to a further energy cost which will vary depending on technology. It is possible that if suitable storage infrastructure existed hydrogen could be generated relatively independently of the instantaneous energy demand.

:footnotes:
[fn:options] It is noted that at least transiently, the end result will likely be some combination of both
[fn:HydEn] This is relative to the current energy density of Lithium Ion battery
[fn:bioGass] Biogas may also be used, however it seems unlikely that biogas will ever become a dominant source of heating due to fundamental limitations in available bio-matter
