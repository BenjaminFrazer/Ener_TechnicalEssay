* Ideas
- something about aggregators
- fast frequency response vs Inertia
  + if you have faster acting fast frequency response you can get away with less inertia
- what are the economics of using converters as inertial vs as fast frequency response
- what really are the fundamental limits of converter inertia
- in the new proposed GB fast frequency response framework, there's two different response times specified
  + response within 2 seconds
